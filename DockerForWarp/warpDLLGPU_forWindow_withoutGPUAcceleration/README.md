These are for the Windows OS.
If you failed to compile GPUAcceleration in Warp.sln, you can just add these dll files into your $PATH directory to dynamically link with these libraries.

    GPUAcceleration.dll cudnn64_7.dll       cusolver64_100.dll  zlib.dll   
    cublas64_100.dll    cufft64_100.dll     fftw3f.dll   
    cudart64_100.dll    curand64_100.dll    tiff.dll   

Due to the Github size limitation, I couldn't upload these.
